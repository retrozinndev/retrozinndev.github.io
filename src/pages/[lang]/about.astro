        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        I'm a high school student from Brazil.
        I absolutely love open-source and programming stuff!
        </p>

        <h2>Journey</h1>
        <p>
        I've been learning a lot stuff about programming and GNU/Linux since 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been using GNU/Linux as my primary operating system since last year, with 
            <LinkButton href="https://fedoraproject.org/workstation" spacing={false} external>
                Fedora Workstation
            </LinkButton> and 
            then in the start of this year, moving to 
            <LinkButton href="https://archlinux.org" external spacing={false}>
                Arch Linux
            </LinkButton>.
        </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>

        <h2>Recent Projects</h2>
        <p>
            I started working on a Desktop Environment recently, called 
            <a href="https://github.com/retrozinndev/colorshell">colorshell</a>.
            It's made to be used with the 
            <LinkButton href="https://hypr.land" external spacing={false}>
                Hyprland Wayland Compositor
            </LinkButton>,
            making usage of amazing technologies like GnomeJS, TypeScript, GTK 4, AGS and the Astal Libraries to create a nice environment for your desktop.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's also a music player I've been working on, but it's a little bit abandoned for now. 
            Still, I have a lot of ideas for it, so I won't be completely abandoning the app!!
            <br>
            The Music Player is called <a href="https://github.com/retrozinndev/Vibe">Vibe</a>,
            it's expected to use GnomeJS, GTK, Gnim and GStreamer to make things work.
