        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        I'm a high school student from Brazil.
        I absolutely love open-source and programming stuff!
        </p>

        <h2>Journey</h1>
        <p>
        I've been learning a lot about programming and GNU/Linux since 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, I've been using GNU/Linux as my primary operating system since 2024! I started
            this journey using 
            <LinkButton href="https://fedoraproject.org/workstation" spacing={false} external>
                Fedora Workstation
            </LinkButton> and 
            later on the same year, I moved to 
            <LinkButton href="https://archlinux.org" external spacing={false}>
                Arch Linux
            </LinkButton> and I'm still using it until today(not planning to change at all).
        </p>

        <h2>Other Interests</h2>
        <p>
            Besides tech, I really like watching Anime! I am a guy that really likes slice of life, 
            romcoms and a little bit of drama 😜 <br>
            My favorite shows are:
            <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshi_no_Ko">Oshi no Ko</a>, 
            <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocchi_the_Rock!">Bocchi The Rock!</a> and 
            <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaoru_Hana_wa_Rin_to_Saku">Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku</a> (The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity).

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
            I really love listening to Vocaloid while I'm doing anything! My most-listened vocaloid(and also others: utau; synth-v...) 
            artists are mostly inabakumori, JamieP, 32ki, DECO*27 and ime44.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than vocaloid, I really enjoy songs by artists like Vaundy, Kenshi Yonezu, Ado, natori, 9Lana and Hoshimachi Suisei. I Also love
            listening to their songs while coding or doing anything else. 😸 <br>
            The genres I usually listen to are J-pop, J-rock and Vocaloid.
        </p>

        <h2>Recent Projects</h2>
        <p>
            I started working on a Desktop Environment recently, called 
            <a href="https://github.com/retrozinndev/colorshell">colorshell</a>.
            It's made to be used with the 
            <LinkButton href="https://hypr.land" external spacing={false}>
                Hyprland Wayland Compositor
            </LinkButton>,
            making usage of amazing technologies like GnomeJS, TypeScript, GTK 4, AGS and the Astal Libraries to create a nice environment for your desktop.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's also a music player I've been working a lot on recently. You should check it out!
            <br>
            The Music Player is called <a href="https://github.com/retrozinndev/Vibe">Vibe</a>,
            it uses GnomeJS, GTK, Gnim and GStreamer to make things work.
